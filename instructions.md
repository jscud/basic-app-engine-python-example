# Getting Started

## Welcome

In the following steps, you'll try out a simple app that can run on Google App
Engine.

## Running a local preview

To run your app on this machine, run the `dev_appserver.py` script on the
directory that contains the source code for the app. Copy the following
command and run it in the terminal:

```bash
dev_appserver.py hello-app
```

## Congratulations

You've finished this brief example of trying out a web application on Google
App Engine.
